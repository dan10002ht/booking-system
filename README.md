# 🎟️ Event Ticket Booking System - Microservices Architecture

## 🎯 System Overview

A high-performance event ticket booking system built with microservices architecture designed for scalability, consistency, and high availability. The system supports:

- **100,000+ concurrent users** with response time < 200ms
- **Real-time updates** for users about ticket availability
- **Eventual consistency** with strong consistency for critical operations
- **Horizontal scaling** for all services
- **Fault tolerance** with circuit breakers and retry mechanisms

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Core Principles

- **Event-Driven Architecture** with Redis Pub/Sub and Kafka
- **CQRS Pattern** for booking and ticket services
- **Saga Pattern** for distributed transactions
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern** for inter-service communication
- **gRPC Communication** for high-performance inter-service calls
- **Rate Limiting** and **Load Balancing** at gateway level

### Technology Stack

- **API Gateway**: Node.js (Express) + Redis + gRPC client
- **Authentication**: Node.js + JWT + Redis + gRPC server
- **Booking Engine**: Java (Spring Boot) + Redis + PostgreSQL + gRPC
- **Payment Processing**: Java + Stripe/PayPal integration + gRPC
- **Real-time**: Node.js + WebSocket + Redis Pub/Sub
- **Message Queue**: Redis Queue + Kafka (for high throughput)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (primary) + Redis (cache)
- **Inter-Service Communication**: gRPC (high performance) + REST (external APIs)
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana + ELK Stack

## 🔄 System Flow

### 1. User Authentication Flow

```
User → Gateway → Auth Service (gRPC) → JWT Token → User Session
```

### 2. Ticket Booking Flow (Critical Path)

```
User → Gateway → Rate Limiter → Ticket Service (gRPC) → Booking Service (gRPC) → Payment Service (gRPC) → Notification Service (gRPC)
```

### 3. Real-time Updates Flow

```
Booking Service → Redis Pub/Sub → Realtime Service → WebSocket → User Browser
```

### 4. Background Processing Flow

```
Booking Service → Kafka → Email Worker → Invoice Service (gRPC) → Notification Service (gRPC)
```

## 🆕 Booking Worker Service (Go)

### Overview

The **Booking Worker Service** is implemented in **Go (Golang)** for maximum concurrency and performance. Go's goroutines and channels make it ideal for handling high-throughput booking queues, ensuring fairness and efficiency for 100,000+ clients.

### Key Features (Go-specific)

- **Goroutines**: Lightweight concurrency for processing thousands of queue jobs in parallel
- **Channels**: Safe communication between worker routines
- **High Performance**: Minimal latency and high throughput
- **Go Libraries**: go-redis, segmentio/kafka-go, grpc-go, gorilla/websocket

### Booking Flow with Queue

1. **Client Request**: Client requests to book a ticket.
2. **Queue Placement**: Client is placed in a distributed queue (e.g., Redis List, Kafka Topic).
3. **Queue Notification**: Client receives their queue position and estimated wait time.
4. **Worker Processing**: Booking Worker dequeues requests and processes them one by one:
   - Checks ticket availability
   - Reserves ticket
   - Notifies client to proceed with payment
5. **Timeout/Failure Handling**: If client does not complete payment in time, ticket is released and next client is notified.
6. **Completion**: Successful bookings are confirmed and tickets are issued.

### Technologies

- **Redis**: For fast, distributed queue management
- **Kafka**: For event-driven queueing and scaling
- **gRPC**: For inter-service communication
- **WebSocket**: For real-time queue updates to clients
- **Spring Boot**: Service implementation

### Related Services

- **Booking Service**: Handles booking logic and ticket reservation
- **Ticket Service**: Manages ticket inventory
- **Realtime Service**: Sends real-time updates to clients

## 🆕 Check-in Service

### Overview

The **Check-in Service** is responsible for validating tickets and processing check-in events when users attend events. It ensures that only valid tickets are used, prevents double check-in, and integrates with analytics and notification services for real-time updates and reporting.

### Key Features

- **Ticket Validation**: Verifies ticket authenticity and status (used/unused, valid/invalid)
- **Check-in Event**: Records check-in time, location, and staff
- **Integration**: Communicates with Ticket Service (for ticket status), Analytics Service (for attendance data), and Notification Service (for check-in confirmations)
- **Security**: Authenticates staff and protects check-in APIs
- **Real-time Updates**: Optionally notifies event organizers or users upon check-in

### Typical Flow

1. **Staff scans ticket** (QR/barcode)
2. **Check-in Service** validates ticket via Ticket Service
3. **If valid**: marks ticket as used, records check-in event, notifies analytics/notification
4. **If invalid**: returns error (already used, invalid, etc.)

### Related Services

- **Ticket Service**: Ticket status and updates
- **Analytics Service**: Attendance and event stats
- **Notification Service**: Check-in confirmations
- **Auth Service**: Staff authentication
